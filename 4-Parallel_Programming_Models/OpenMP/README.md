# Introduction to OpenMP

## Exercise 1: Rewrite `vec_add_serial.cpp` with OpenMP
* Make a copy of original code with name `vec_add_omp.cpp`
* Identify the section to parallelize
* Code it!
* Don't forget the flag to enable OpenMP in compilation

## Exercise 2: Rewrite `vec_total_serial.cpp` with OpenMP
* Be careful of [race condition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aF0q7NfwfA)
